### 2. **Test Banner Generation API**
```bash
# Get an artist ID from Airtable, then run:
node scripts/test-banner-generation.js --run-test
```

### 3. **Verify Theme System**
- Navigate between different artist pages
- Notice how colors change dynamically
- Check that fallbacks work when data is missing
